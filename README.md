# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate: Case Study

## Business task:
Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company in Chicago, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth and would like to convert casual riders into members. To do such, I have been asked by the marketing department to analyze historical trip data to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ. These trends will give us more insight on why casual riders would buy Cyclist annual memberships and will ultimately help us achieve our business goal. From these insights, I will make recommendations on new marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.
